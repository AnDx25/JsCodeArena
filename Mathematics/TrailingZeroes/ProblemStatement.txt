Problem : Given a number find number of trailing zeroes in it's factorial
        Example : 5!=120 : Number of trailing zero=1
                  10!=3628800 : Number of trailing zero=2
Solution : 
            Naive Approach: 1. calculate factorial of number
                            2. divide factorial till it is divisible by zero
                            TC : O(n), But it might lead to overflow when a very large number comes then factorial might gets overflowed

            Efficient Approach: Count Number of 2 and 5 but since number of 5 is less than 2 so count number of 5
                                So for number of 5 in n it will appear at every 5th place of the factorial of number
                                So number of 5= n/5
                                But for number which consists of 25 in it's factorial will have two 5 so
                                number of two 5's=n/25 (every 25th place in fact of number)

                                and so on untill n/5^k=0

                                TC : theta(lognbase5) with no issue of overflow
