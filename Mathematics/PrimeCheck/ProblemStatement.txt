Problem: Given a number need to tell if it is a prime number or not

Explanation : Prime Numbers: A number whose divisors are only 1 and the number itself
              Composite Numbers : Number which have divisors more than 1 and number it self

              Example : n= 13 : Prime Number
                        n=14 : Not prime number
              Note : 1 is neither prime nor Composite
                    2 is the only even prime number

Solution: Naive Approach : Check for each number from 2 to n-1 if it divide n
                            TC :WorstCase O(n): When n is a prime number
                               :Best Case O(1): When n is an even number or it is 1

          Efficient Approach : Based on the idea that divisiors always occurs in pairs
                                For example 30: (1,30), (2,15), (5,6), (3,10)

                                Hence for a number N there would be always two divisiors X and Y such that
                                X*Y=N
                                If X<=Y (considering small digits of pairs)
                                X^2<N
                                X<sqrt(N)
                                So it means if under sqrt(n) only we will get one digit which can divide given number N

                                TC : O(sqrt(N))

                                This can be made more Efficient by checking in start if  number is divisible by 2 or 3 
                                which in turn saves us to go for other possibility of number divisible by 4,6,8 etc
                                and 3,6,9,15 etc
