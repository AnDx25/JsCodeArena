Given a Rope of length N, you have to cut this rope into maximum number of pieces such that every pieces
have length either as A, or as B, or as C.

Sample Test Cases 
1.  I/P : N=5, {A,B,C}={2,5,1}
    O/P : 5

    Explanation : For every piece of rope we are having three choices either to choose A, B or C
                For Every Piece we have to determine maxOf(currentLength-a,currentLength-b,currentLength-c)
