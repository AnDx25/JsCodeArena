Problem : Given an array which consists of stocks for upcoming n days, we can buy stock on any day and can sell stock
on any upcoming day. We need to maximize the profit of by purchasing a stock on a price and selling it on
higher rate.

        Example :
               1.)  arr=[1,5,3,8,12]
                    O/P : 13
                Explanation : Buy on day 1 at cost 1 and sell on day 2 at cost 5 : Profit=5-1=4
                                            +
                              Buy on day 3 at cost 3 and sell on day 5 at cost 12 : Profit=12-3=9

                              = 9+4=13
                2.) arr=[30,20,10]
                    O/P=0
                    Explanation : If prices are sorted in decreasing order then never be going to get profit

                3.) arr=[10,20,30]
                    O/P=20
                    Explanation : If prices are sorted in increasing order then buy on first days and sell on last day

                4.) arr=[1,5,3,1,2,8]
                    O/P=11 ({5-1}+{8-1}=11)

Hint : In this problem we not only have to think on which particular day to buy stock and on which particular day to sell
but we also need to find out on which day again buy the stock to sell them in further upcoming day so that total
profit is maximized.
And thus inorder to

Solution : Here we will be providing three solutions

            1.) Naive Approach :    -Will take start index and end index of the array
                                    -Check if number of element <=1 i.e end<=start then return 0 Profit
                                    -For 2 and more elements will consider every pair using two loops arr[i] and arr[j] such that i<j and price[i]<price[j]
                                    -Once we have such pair then we will find the Current profit by arr[j]-arr[i]
                                    -And thereby recursively calling the left elements of i and elements of right of j
                                    -And Keep on tracking maximum profit at every step

            2.) Efficient Approach : In this Approach idea is simple buy the stock when it is at minimum and keep on adding the profit untill and unless graph is not getting down to low value

            Ex : For Stocks [1,5,3,8,12]
            Buy on day 1 at cost 1 and sell the stock before it reaches to price 3
            So sell the stock when it is at 5 : So profit is 5-1 =4
            Again Buy on day 3 at price 3 and keep on adding the profit if graph is not going down
            (8-3)+(12-8)=5+4=9

            So total profit is 4+9=13
