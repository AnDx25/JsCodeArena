Problem : Given a binary array you need to determine what are the minimum
          group flips possible to make the array same

          Example : I/P =[1,1,0,0,0,1]
                    O/P : From 2 to 4 {if we flip elements from index 2 to 4 i.e changing 0 to 1}
                         Then the array would be [1,1,1,1,1,1]
                         If we choose to flip the group of one's then there will be 2 group to flip
                         from 0 to 1 and from 5 to 5


Solution : 
            -Efficient Approach :
                - You can notice that for any binary array for zero and ones
                    Maximum Difference between number of group of zeroes and group of ones
                    is always less than or equal to 1
                        - Example : 
                                - Group Counts Differ by one
                                    1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1  : 3-2=1
                                    1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1  : 6-5 =1
                                - Group Counts Differ by zero
                                    0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 : 2-2=0

                - You can notice that always the second group {the one which came after first 
                    group for example for 1 1 0 0 here 0 0 is second group}
                    is always going to be the one which will have less or equal number
                    than to more number of groups
                -So we have to keep track for second group only
