Problem : Trapping Rain Water

Solution : 
            1.) Naive Solution : O(n^2)
            2.) Efficient Solution
                In this approach we dont compute lmax and rmax for every element inside the loop we will 
                precompute the lmax and rmax for every element in arrays lmax and rmax respectively 
                and will use it in our main loop to get the result
                TC : theta(n)
