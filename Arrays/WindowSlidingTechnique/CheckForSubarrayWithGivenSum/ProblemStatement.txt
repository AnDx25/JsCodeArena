Problem : Given an unsorted array of non negative integers.
        Find if there is a subarray with given sum

Example : I/P : arr=[1,4,20,3,10,5], sum=33
          O/P : Yes

Solution : 
            Naive Solution : O(n^2)

            Efficient Approach :
                - Two pointers one is start for start point of the window and end for end point of the window
                - We keep on adding elements to the current window
                - untill the sum is smaller than given sum
                - when sum becomes greater we keep removing the beginning elements from the window
                - When we find given sum is reached then return Yes
                - Note : Always for every new element cleans the window if the previous sum window was more than given sum then Add further element

                - Note : This Approach would not work for negative element because if we had deleted some start number when current sum is more
                        then we will deleted start elements but you may never know because of further coming negative elements
                        those start elements could have make the given sum
