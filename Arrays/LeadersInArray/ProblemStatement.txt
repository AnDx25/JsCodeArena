Given an array you need to find leaders in that array

Leaders : In an array every element is leader which has no elements on right of it which is greater than it

Ex : I/P : [7,10,4,3,6,5,2]
     O/P : 10,6,5,2

     Here 7 is not leader because 10 which is at right of 7 is greater than 7
        10 is leader because no element on right of 10 is greater than 10
        4 is not leader because of 6
        3 is not leader because of 6
        6 is leader because 6> 5 and 2
        5 is leader because 5>2
        2 is leader because no element on right of it

Note : So a right most element in an array will always be a leader

    I/P : Sorted in asc order=[10,20,30] then rightmost element is the only leader

    I/P : Sorted in desc order=[30,20,10] then every element is the leader

In order to solve this we are having following two approaches
    1. Naive Approach : In this approach we will use two loops one loop to pick up an element and   
                        another loop to compare each and every element inorder to determine if an element at right of it is greater
