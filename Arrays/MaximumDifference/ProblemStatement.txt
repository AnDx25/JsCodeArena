Given an array you need to find maximum value of arr[j]-arr[i] such that j>i;

Example : I/P : arr[]=[2,3,10,6,4,8,1]
          O/P : 8
        Explain : 10-2 =8 is the highest difference among all

        If array is in sorted asc order then Highest diff=LastEl-FirstEl

Two approaches
                1. Naive : Run two loops and take out difference among each element and compare the result to find out maximum difference

                            TC: theta(n^2);
                
                2. Efficient :  ->In this approach we track the minimum value of element obtained so far
                                ->We dont need to take out difference between every element we just take the difference
                                between the current element and the minimum element and update the previous max diff if new one is more

                                TC: theta(n)
