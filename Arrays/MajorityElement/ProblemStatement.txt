Problem : Given an array you need to find index of an element which occurs more than n/2 times in the array

Solution :
            -   Naive Approach : 
                                - This approach is to using two loops to find count of every element and
                                  comparing if it is more than n/2 times and return index
                                - TC : O(n^2)
            
            -   Efficient Approach :
                                    - This approach knowns as Moores Voting Algorithm
                                    - This approach works in two phases
                                        - PHASE 1 : This phase just determines if any majority element exists or not
                                        - PHASE 2 : This phase is to validate if the given index from PHASE 1 is actually a majority element
                                                    Basically PHASE 2 is to ensure if the provided index is not majority element then return -1
                                    - TC : O(n)
