Problem :   Given an array Arr of n integers arranged in a circular fashion. Your task is to find the minimum absolute difference between adjacent elements

Example :   - Input : Arr[] = {8,-8,9,-9,10,-11,12}
            - Output : 4
            - Explanation : The absolute difference 
                            between adjacent elements in the given 
                            array are as such: 16 17 18  19 21 23 4
                            (first and last). Among the calculated 
                            absolute difference the minimum is 4.
Note : TC O(n) and SC O(1)
