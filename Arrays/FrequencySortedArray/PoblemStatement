Problem : Given a sorted array we need to count of frequency of each and every element in the array

Example : arr=[10,10,10,20,20,30]
        O/P : 10=3
              20=2
              30=1
        
        Corner Cases arr=[10,10,10]
                    arr=[10,20,30]

Solution : Compare Current Element with Previous Element 
            while i<arr.length
                If Curr==Prev
                    then freq++
                        i++
                //If not same
                print CurrentElement and its frequency
                freq=1 //Initalizing to freq for another differnt element
            //If single element in array or it is a last element
            if n==1 || arr[n-1]!==arr[n-2]
            print arr[n-1] with freq=1
