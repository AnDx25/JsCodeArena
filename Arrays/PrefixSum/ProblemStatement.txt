Given an array arr[] of size n, its prefix sum array is another array prefixSum[] of the same size, 
such that the value of prefixSum[i] is arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] â€¦ arr[i].


Problem : Given a fixed array and multiple queries of following
types on the array, how to efficiently perform these queries

I/P :=[2,8,3,9,6,5,4]
Queries getSum(0,2) : It means get sum from index 0 to 2(inclusive)
        getSum(1,3)
        getSum(4,6)

        Idea is to get all these queries answer in 
        O(No of Queries)
        it means every query will be taking O(1) TC
        Here it is allowed to take O(n) time to preprocess this array
