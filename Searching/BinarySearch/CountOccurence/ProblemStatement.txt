Problem : Given a sorted array with duplicates. You need to count occurences of a given element
          
          Example : I/P :arr=[10,20,20,20,30,30]
                         x=20
                    O/P : 3 (20 is present 3 times)

Solution :
            - Naive Approach :  Run a loop and count occurence of given element 
                                TC : O(n)

            - Efficient Approach : find first occurence of given element and last occurence of given element
                                    then count= lastOccur-firstOccur+1
                                    Example : Here for 20 FO=1 and LO=3
                                             count= 3-1+1=3
