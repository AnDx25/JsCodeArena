Problem : Given a sorted array consisting of duplicate elements, You need to determine first occurence of searched element in array

            Example : 
            I/P : arr[]=[1,10,10,10,20,20,40],x=20
            O/P : 4
            Here 20 occured first at index 4

Solution : 
            - Naive Approach :  Run a loop and return as soon as yopu find element else return -1;
                                TC : O(n)
                                SC : O(1)

            - Binary Recursive Approach :   Use Binary Search Approach if element at middle is also present at middle-1 then 
                                            call recusively left part of array
                                            TC : O(log(n))
                                            SC : O(log(n))

            - Binary Iterative Approach :    Use Binary Search Approach if element at middle is also present at middle-1 then 
                                            decrement high by high=middle-1;
                                            TC : O(log(n))
                                            SC : O(1)
        Conclusion : Binary Iterative Approach is the best solution here
